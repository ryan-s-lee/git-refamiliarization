## Preface
This webpage was created as an assignment for **UCSD's CSE 110 course**. Part of it
is to introduce myself as a programmer and as a person.

There's [a youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkZzg7Vowao)
featuring Leslie Lamport where he relates the idea that math is to coding what 
writing and ideas are to language. 

> Writing is something that involves mental effort; you're thinking about what 
you're going to say. The words have some importance, but even they are 
secondary to the ideas. In the same way, programs are built on ideas. They 
have to do something, and what they're supposed to do is like what writing is 
supposed to convey.

Throughout my time at UC San Diego, I've come to subscribe to Lamport's application
of this thinking to problems, math, and code. When I code, I try to the best of my ability to: 

1. Describe a real problem I or others are dealing with in the present using math
2. adhere my code to that mathematical description.

These aspects of my ideal software engineering process provide aim for my work.
I recognize that often I have to throw out and test code quickly, without checking rigorously
if it will work; as one of my professors has stated, "cowboy coding" is sometimes necessary, 
especially if time and mental constraints are placed on a complex issue. Regardless, I try to be 
precise when I can.

I started learning code with Java, but am now mostly familiar with C. I'm currently aiming to 
work with computer systems, but in my personal projects I've often found a need to provide 
a clean user interface, and therefore hope to pick up some skills relating to that during my 
time at UCSD. I believe CSE 110 will be excellent exposure in this regard.
